# Ghost-Game
It is an Android App that I made as part of  Google course that I took and successfully completed  
There are two versions of the game  
    1> Using SimpleDictionary.java which uses simple data structure such as ArrayList and BinarySearching  
    2> Using FinalDictionary.java which uses complex data structure such as TrieNode
